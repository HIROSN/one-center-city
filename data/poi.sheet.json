    "text": "[The city](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/third-avenue-corridor/pdf/2014_1003_factsheet.pdf) just finished building new concrete lanes in the Belltown part of Third Avenue to withstand the punishment of 20-ton buses.\n\nThird Avenue fills at rush hour, while carrying 2,500 buses and more than [42,000 riders](http://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/programs-projects/third-ave-improvements.aspx) per weekday. Can the bus lanes work better? Some ideas being considered:\n\n• An all-day ban on general traffic on Third, which is currently forbidden only at weekday peaks, 6 a.m.-9 a.m. and 3 p.m.-6:30 p.m.\n  \n• Pre-paid boarding for all buses on Third — but Metro or the city might need to find millions of dollars to route utilities for more ORCA fare-card readers, and to hire more fare inspectors.\n\n• Landscaping, decluttering and brighter lighting.\n\nTotal cost:  $17.4 million."
